I am a devops/infrastructure/cloud engineer with 10 years of experience in the tech industry. With a background as a software engineer before moving to infrastructure, I bring pragmatic programming and clean code to infrastructure code. As a hobby and as a creative outlet, I do comedy in both improv and standup. Other hobbies include attending concerts and other musical experiences, board games, and table-top roleplaying games."
